        "summary": "This paper introduces a machine learning potential repository that includes\nPareto optimal machine learning potentials. It also shows the systematic\ndevelopment of accurate and fast machine learning potentials for a wide range\nof elemental systems. As a result, many Pareto optimal machine learning\npotentials are available in the repository from a website. Therefore, the\nrepository will help many scientists to perform accurate and fast atomistic\nsimulations.",

        "title": "Diversity in Machine Learning",
        "summary": "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
