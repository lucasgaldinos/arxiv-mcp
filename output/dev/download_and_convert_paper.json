    "abstract": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being  more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU.  On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing  both with large and limited training data.\n% \\1}\n\n%TODO(noam): update results for new models.\n\n%llion@: FAIR's paper seems to concentrate solely on the convolutional aspect of their model and have the attention as an after thought almost, this gives us a good opportunity to differentiate ourselves from their paper.\n\n%We are simpler in a number of ways and should have the simplicity as a big selling point:\n%\\1\n% No convolutions\n% No need for such careful initializations and %normalization.\n% Simpler non-lineararities, they use the gated linear %units.\n% Less layers?\n%\\1\n%One thing we do more is that we have self attention.\n%Another selling point is the increased interpretability as %shown with the visualizations. Which comes from the %simplicity and use of only attentions.",
