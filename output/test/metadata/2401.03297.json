The objective is to find a minimum cost hamiltonian cycle $C$ such that $C$ visits all the colors and each color appears exactly once in $C$. We prove that Colored Points TSP is NP-hard by reducing the classical TSP to it. Here, we present a $\\1{3}$-approximation algorithm for this problem such that $r$ is the radius of the minimum color-spanning circle of the points.\n\nThe Colored Points Traveling Salesman Problem (Colored Points TSP) is introduced in this work as a novel variation of the traditional Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in which the set of points is partitioned into multiple classes, each of which is represented by a distinct color (or label). The goal is to find a minimum cost cycle $C$ that visits all the colors and only makes each one appears once. This issue has various applications in the fields of transportation, goods distribution network, postal network, inspection, insurance, banking, etc. By reducing the traditional TSP to it, we can demonstrate that Colored Points TSP is NP-hard. Here, we offer a $\\1{3}$-approximation algorithm to solve this issue, where $r$ denotes the radius of the points' smallest color-spanning circle. The algorithm has been implemented, executed on random datasets, and compared against the brute force method.",
